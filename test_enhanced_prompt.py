    On 14th September 2025, at about 8:15 PM, complainant Rajesh Kumar, S/o Venkat Rao, 
    aged 34 years, Scheduled Caste, occupation: Agricultural labourer, resident of Gollapadu 
    village, Bhimavaram Mandal, reported that while he was returning from weekly shandy on 
    his bicycle carrying groceries, he was intercepted near Narsapur Road culvert by a group 
    of four persons.
    
    The accused are identified as:
    Ramesh Babu, aged about 28, S/o Narayana, resident of Gollapadu, known history-sheeter.
    Srinivas, aged about 30, brother-in-law of village sarpanch.
    Murali Krishna, aged about 32, driver, resident of Mogaltur.
    One unknown person, medium build, wearing black shirt.
    
    They came on two motorbikes (Red Pulsar AP-37-BX-4321 and Black Splendor AP-37-CQ-9187) 
    and obstructed him. Ramesh Babu and Srinivas abused him by caste name, shouting 'Mala lanj‚Ä¶' 
    in public view. Murali Krishna pointed a country-made pistol and fired one round in the air, 
    while the unknown person beat him with a stick, causing bleeding injury on his left arm. 
    They forcibly snatched his Samsung mobile phone worth ‚Çπ15,000 and ‚Çπ12,500 cash from his pocket. 
    They further threatened that if he complained to police, they would kill him and set fire to his hut.
    
    Local villagers (Suresh, Koteswara Rao, and Lakshmi) witnessed the incident but ran away in fear. 
    Rajesh Kumar fell on the ground and was later rescued by passers-by who shifted him to 
    Bhimavaram Government Hospital. ‡∞à ‡∞∏‡∞Ç‡∞ò‡∞ü‡∞® ‡∞µ‡∞≤‡∞® ‡∞Ö‡∞§‡∞®‡±Å ‡∞ö‡∞æ‡∞≤‡∞æ ‡∞≠‡∞Ø‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡±ã‡∞≥‡∞®‡∞ï‡±Å ‡∞ó‡±Å‡∞∞‡∞Ø‡±ç‡∞Ø‡∞æ‡∞°‡±Å.
